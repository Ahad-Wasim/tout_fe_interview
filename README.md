# Tout Frontend Interview Project

This is an open book take home test. There are no *right* or *wrong* answers. The goal is to get an understanding of how you solve the problem. Creativity is encouraged.

This project has a base Webpack setup with Mocha and ESLint. Using this setup is not required as long as we can `git clone` and run the project.

## Task
> I need a page with six timers on it. The user should be able to see all six timers and the remaining time for each. Once a timer reaches zero, the user can click to restart the timer.

> We need a function on `window` that can be called to set/reset the timers and their durations. This will be tested via the Console in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.


## Running the demo:
```
git clone tout_fe_interview
cd tout_fe_interview
make
```

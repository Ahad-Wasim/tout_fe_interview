# Tout Frontend Interview Project

This is an open book take home test. There are no *right* or *wrong* answers. The goal is to get an understanding of how you solve the problem. Creativity is encouraged. We recommend focusing on your strengths and showing off your skills.

Use any libraries or tools you want. Modify and change any file in this project to fit your needs. To help you get started, the project is a blank page built with Webpack and Babel. Mocha and ESLint are available for testing.


## Task
> I need a page with six timers on it. The user should be able to see all six timers and the remaining time for each. Once a timer reaches zero, the user can click to restart the timer.

> We need a function on `window` that can be called to set/reset the timers and their durations. This will be tested via the Console in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox.


## Running the demo:
```
git clone git@github.com:Tout/tout_fe_interview.git
cd tout_fe_interview
git checkout -b YOUR_NAME
make
```

## Building
Build will run webpack, compiling the javascript and css files into the bundle.js loaded in index.html.
```
make build
```

## Finish
Once you are happy with the application create a pull request on Github.
